# Planting for Progress

Planting for Progress is a community-sourced project started by Agatha Isabel (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/plant.ma" target="_blank">@plant.ma</a>). Members of our community donate plants to be auctioned, and the proceeds are donated to local organizations and non-profits. The project started as a way to support Black Lives Matter and has since expanded to other causes, including LGBTQ+, voting rights and various NYC-local organizations.

Planting for Progress has had three rounds of auctions so far, raising over $6.6k!

## About Agatha

Agatha is a digital risk professional by day, plant lover 24/7. She has always been fond of nature, growing up with plants for inside and outside her home. She began her plant collection when she moved to the East Coast from the West Coast, and has grown not only a collection, but a community. Follow her and her plant collection on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/plant.ma" target="_blank">@plant.ma</a>

### Planting for Progress

Through her plant collection and community, she found a creative way to give back to marginalized communities as well as support social justice causes by auctioning a Pink Princess Philodendron. One thing led to another, and now sheâ€™s not auctioned more than 35+ rare plants since May 2020.
